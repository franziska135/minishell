--all errors should be handled properly

--starting minishell with "env -i | ./minishell" creates endless loop
	- env -i passes an emtpy env to the shell

--A="s -l"// l$A


--clear returns error


--export | grep a returns error




-- space in history -> bash saves commands that start with space	NOTE: my bash doesnt!
--expansion: $"" leads to segmentation fault				NOTE: it doesnt, was it something else?
