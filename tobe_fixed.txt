--all errors should be handled properly

--starting minishell with "env -i | ./minishell" creates endless loop			you should not do that (its not env -i, its piping)
	- env -i passes an emtpy env to the shell

--A="s -l"// l$A		almost resolved. export A="'ls -s'"; $A has leaks


--clear returns error		TERM prints wrong


--export | grep a returns error		env works but prints END and START


--ambiguous redirection




-- space in history -> bash saves commands that start with space	NOTE: my bash doesnt!
--expansion: $"" leads to segmentation fault				NOTE: it doesnt, was it something else?
