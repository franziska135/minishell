--all errors should be handled properly

--starting minishell with "env -i | ./minishell" creates endless loop			you should not do that (its not env -i, its piping)
	- env -i passes an emtpy env to the shell

--A="'ls -s'" 			doesnt return correct error is that ok?


--clear returns error		TERM prints wrong


--ambiguous redirection			any failed redir cant free ll cuz its not properly set			
					i think the rest is resolved.

--make and doesnt work.

--echo "hello		world" prints hello world

--heredoc doesnt go to newline.

--cmd not found is not fzsh error.

--expand inside of hd

-- space in history -> bash saves commands that start with space	NOTE: my bash doesnt!
--expansion: $"" leads to segmentation fault				NOTE: it doesnt, was it something else?

--in is_builtin and if_builtin_execute take the print out, thats just for control

--ft_transfer_ll_to_ptr is called before each execv, how to return from this in case of an error?

--pwd check for access --> previous folder delete

--un set "$" segfault
