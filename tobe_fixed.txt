--echo $q
		after many times running gives out ./minishell

--all errors should be handled properly

-- space in history -> bash saves commands that start with space

--starting minishell with "env -i | ./minishell" creates endless loop
	- env -i passes an emtpy env to the shell

fixed: --expansion: $"" leads to segmentation fault

--what happens if PATH is unset
	- atm: no error displayed



PATH= in path_finder line 38 change to PATH
--check for if path is null (node not found)
