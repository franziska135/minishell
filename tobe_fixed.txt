-- space in history -> bash saves commands that start with space	NOTE: my bash doesnt!
--expansion: $"" leads to segmentation fault				NOTE: it doesnt, was it something else?

--is_builtin function strncmp with \0

--in is_builtin and if_builtin_execute take the print out, thats just for control

-- piping leaks sometimes!
