--all errors should be handled properly

--starting minishell with "env -i | ./minishell" creates endless loop			you should not do that (its not env -i, its piping)
	- env -i passes an emtpy env to the shell

--A="'ls -s'" 			doesnt return correct error is that ok?


--clear returns error		TERM prints wrong


--export | grep a returns error		env works but prints END and START


--ambiguous redirection			any failed redir cant free ll cuz its not properly set			i think the rest is resolved.


--make and git(comment) doesnt work.


--heredoc doesnt go to newline.


--cmd not found is not fzsh error.




-- space in history -> bash saves commands that start with space	NOTE: my bash doesnt!
--expansion: $"" leads to segmentation fault				NOTE: it doesnt, was it something else?
