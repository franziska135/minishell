--all errors should be handled properly


--A="'ls -s'" 			doesnt return correct error is that ok?


--clear returns error		TERM prints wrong


--export | grep a returns error		env works but prints END and START


--make and doesnt work.


--heredoc doesnt go to newline.
--expand inside of hd


--cmd not found is not fzsh error.


--check for deletion\permission of parent dir



-- space in history -> bash saves commands that start with space	NOTE: my bash doesnt!
--starting minishell with "env -i | ./minishell" creates endless loop			you should not do that (its not env -i, its piping)
	- env -i passes an emtpy env to the shell
